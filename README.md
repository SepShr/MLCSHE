# MLCSHE: Machine Learning Component Systemic Hazard Envelope

ML Component Systemic Hazard Envelope project, or *MLCSHE* (pronounced /'mɪlʃ/), is a cooperative coevolutionary search algorithm that automatically identifies the *hazard boundary* of a ML component in an ML-enabled Autonomous System (MLAS), given a system safety requirement.

This work is done at [Nanda Lab](https://www.nanda-lab.ca/), EECS Department, University of Ottawa.
